## Hey there! 👋

I'm Yuvraj Singh, currently studying Cyber Security in London. I love exploring new technologies, especially when they challenge how things work behind the scenes.

I code whenever inspiration strikes - usually when I think of something I find interesting or useful for field development. So my interests revolve usually around cyber security, open-source tools, and automation projects.

🚧 I’m currently working on several projects some of which you can find on my GitHub profile 🚧

- [Malware Simulation](https://github.com/yyyuvraaj/MalwareSimulation)
- [Data Visualization](https://github.com/yyyuvraaj/Dataset-Visualization)
- [Example IT Infrastructure](https://github.com/yyyuvraaj/IT-Infrastructure-Design)

*Some may be unfinished and or private* :/

I’m always open to collaborating on exciting ideas or learning from others in the community.
